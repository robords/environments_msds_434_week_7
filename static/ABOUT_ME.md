# About Me

I really enjoyed putting this project together! Be sure to check out the ["About the App"](about) page to 
learn more about it!

I'm interested in learning how to use machine learning to help us make better decisions.  
I love designing scalable, low-cost data engineering solutions, and building a chart or two.  I'm especially
interested in figuring out how individual hobbyists can use ML in their everyday lives, or just to build out
a portfolio of data science projects without breaking the bank or incurring big bills on the cloud.
  
I'm a student at Northwestern University studying data science with a concentration in data engineering, 
and the rest of the time manage large-scale, globe-spanning programs and roadmaps for a cloud provider.
